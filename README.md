## General info
This application started as a toy project to apply what I've learned about Layered Architecture and GRASP principles. 
Furthmore, I have created a Windows Form Application in C# for the GUI and used the code written in Python to perform the operations. 
During the development of this project I have learned a lot about processes between different programming language (The communication between C# and Python).

## Technologies
* Python 3.7, IDE used: Pycharm - version 1.0
* Python 3.7 + .NET (C#), IDEs used: Pycharm + VS 2019 - version 2.0

## Setup
In order to run the program, clone this repo and install Visual Studio 2019 (or 2015/2017) and 
IDLE (or any other integrated development environment for Python).

## Features
List of features ready and TODOs for future development
* It can perform the basic arithmetic operations (+,-,*,/) on numbers of any length with different number bases.
* As the aplication works with numbers of any length, it can be used to do operations with very large numbers in base 10.

To-do list:
* A better graphical interface.

## Status
Project is: finished, altough some changes to the GUI are very welcomed.

## Inspiration
The Windows Calculator application.
